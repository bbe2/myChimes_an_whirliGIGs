My creativity is fueled by junk, waste, scrap, artifacts, and refuse.  

I love cutting, drilling, and making a melody out of <insert sound box> pipe twangs, bonks, fluttering, and swaying.  

my main gig, is whirligigs and wind gongs. I find the wind whispy and whimsical and feel putting it to work as a means to sing to sing and welcome our angel guardians.

This page keeps growing with my tools, processes, and optimal methods such as using the cast iron bottoms of old pole lamps for gongers.

Gold scrapping is also incredibly fun and environmentally rewarding.

 The bottom line with gold scrappng is this, if you access to a facility that gets tvs, old computers, telecom anything, old stereos (especially Monster equipment) and love to destress banging things up. Well grab all that you can whenever you can. The trick is to take it right apart, get the main boards, and toss all the junk away. If you can do over a gravel road so you dont have to worry about the hundreds of screws you will drop, even better. Then welcome to transistors, varistors, tantulum, palladium, silver, and gold harvesting. Seem weird? well, just go on ebay and type gold circuit board fingers and it will start to make some sense.
