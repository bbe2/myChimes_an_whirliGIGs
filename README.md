My creativity is fueled by junk, waste, scrap, artifacts, and refuse.  

I love cutting, drilling, and making a melody out of <insert sound box> pipe twangs, bonks, fluttering, and swaying.  

My main gig, is whirligigs and gongs. I love to hear them and hope to inspire others to grow and vibrate.

Gold scrapping is also incredibly fun and environmentally rewarding.
The bottom line with gold scrapping is whether you can readily collect computers, telecom, and any stereo equipment with gold-plated connectors. If not, it is not as worth it as you need to stockpile a bit to resell on eBay or extract the gold yourself.

The trick is to take the items apart right away. If you can unscrew it while on your truck tailgate, it will make clean-up much faster. I like this video to learn about valuable pieces such as varistors, tantalum, palladium, silver, and gold fingerlings.
