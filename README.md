My creativity is fueled by junk, waste, scrap, artifacts, and refuse.  

I love cutting, drilling, and making a melody out of <insert sound box> pipe twangs, bonks, fluttering, and swaying.  

my main gig, is whirligigs and wind gongs. I find the wind whispy and whimsical and feel putting it to work as a means to sing to sing and welcome our angel guardians.

This page keeps growing with my tools, processes, and optimal methods such as using the cast iron bottoms of old pole lamps for gongers.

Gold scrapping is also incredibly fun and environmentally rewarding.
The bottom line with gold scrapping is whether you can readily collect computers, telecom, and any stereo equipment with gold-plated connectors. If not, it is not as worth it as you need to stockpile a bit to resell on eBay or extract the gold yourself.

The trick is to take the items apart right away. If you can unscrew it while on your truck tailgate, it will make clean-up much faster. I like this video to learn about valuable pieces such as varistors, tantalum, palladium, silver, and gold fingerlings.
